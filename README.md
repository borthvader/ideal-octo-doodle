# ideal-octo-doodle/Challenge 5

## Description
 
 This project was created to practice the use of third-party APIs and css frameworks, specifically moment.js and bootstrap. I also incorperated some elements of later modules including object constructors. Using these elements I created a webpage to plan the workday using color-coded time blocks and the option to save tasks for future access

 ## Usage
 Using the website is easy, simply load the page and add your text for the specific time of the workday which you would like to schedule. Then press the save button to have your tasks reappear on returning to the page. Below you cam fin a screenshot of the surrent deployment of the site:
